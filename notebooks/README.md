2. **Time_Step-and-Impulse.ipynb**: Comparison of QWE, FHT, FFTLog, and FFT for frequency-to-time transformation.
3. **Benchmark.ipynb**: Example benchmark to check which method is best for a given problem.
4. **Frequency_Dipole-vs-Bipole.ipynb**: Comparison of a 800 m long bipole with a dipole at its centre.

## Developing
